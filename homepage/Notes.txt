page_header.graffle
  Export-as-HTML-Imagemap
  Use png
  Use 125% scale
  Remember to use the style inspector to assign actions to things that should be links.

rake index
  Rewrites index.html using index.erb and page_header.html (and some values in the Rakefile)

The code sample screenshot:
  Taken with Snapz Pro X (this is important, as Snapz is providing the
  dropshadow and about 28 extra pixels widthwise)

  Should be 650 px wide to line up with the page header.

  Transparency: be conscious of WHAT'S IN THE BACKGROUND
