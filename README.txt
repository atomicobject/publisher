== DESCRIPTION:
  
publisher is a module for extending a class with event subscription and firing capabilities.  This is helpful for implementing objects that participate in the Observer design pattern.

== FEATURES/PROBLEMS:
  
* Nice syntax for declaring events that can be subscribed for
* Convenient event firing syntax
* Subscribe / unsubscribe functionality
* Several method name aliases give you the flexibility to make your code more readable (eg, *fire*, *notify*, *emit*)

== SYNOPSIS:

  require 'rubygems'
  require 'publisher'

  class CustomerListHolder
    extend Publisher
    can_fire :customer_added, :list_cleared

    def add_customer(cust)
      (@list ||= []) << cust
      fire :customer_added, cust
    end

    def clear_list
      @list.clear
      fire :list_cleared
    end
  end

  holder = CustomerListHolder.new
  holder.when :customer_added do |cust|
    puts "Customer added! #{cust}"
  end
  holder.when :list_cleared do
    puts "All gone."
  end

  holder.add_customer("Croz")
  holder.add_customer("Matt")
  holder.clear_list
